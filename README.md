# Keyboard-APP-js
Keyboard application using JS, HTML, CSS.

How it works:
Select BPM by selecting custom ms delay between each block. I'd recommend using above 150ms.
Press REC button to record keypresses to an array in JS.
Press PLAY to play the recorded keypresses, which are also displayed with graphics indicating each pressed key. You can also use this button to replay.
Press RESET to reset the array.
You can also play keys without recording them.

Possible upgrades: more tracks, custom delay for each block.
