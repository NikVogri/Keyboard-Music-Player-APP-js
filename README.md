# Keyboard-APP-js
Keyboard application using JS, HTML, CSS.

-- How it works
Select BPM by selecting custom ms delay between each block. I'd recommend to use above 150ms.
Press REC button to record keypresses to an array in JS
Press PLAY to play the recorded keypresses, which are also graphically displayed. You can also use this button to replay.
Press RESET to reset the array.

You can also play keys without recording them.

Possible upgrades.
--more tracks
--custom delay for each block
